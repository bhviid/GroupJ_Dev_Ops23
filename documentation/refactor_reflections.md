# Refactoring reflections

## Mapping of current features

Yet to be done.

## Distributed Workflow

(more may be added)

* Repository Setup
    * Main branch should be the latest working version.
    * Keep a development branch for new features/next steps.
* Branching model
    * Branch out when starting work on a new feature, merge back when done.
* Which distributed workflow?
    * Physical sessions, with the option of remote work.
* How do we expect contributions to look?
    * Equally distributed between the members.
* Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?
    * Github CI, passing the test suite.
